## Polling

### longPoll

* currently every 60s but in G3 can be moved longer because of the events server, I suggest 120s

#### controller longPoll

* update all data from Gateway
* set event array flagging each shade/scene to update
* shades and scenes processed sequentially

#### shade longPoll

* G3: logged, clear motion flag in case event motion-stopped missed
* G2: logged

#### scene longPoll

* G3: logged
* G2: clear ST, Activated flag

### shortPoll

* currently every 5s

#### controller shortPoll

* process general events, sse heartbeat check
* if no events (60min curently) reset sse client

#### shade shortPoll

* process shade events

#### scene shortPoll

* process scene events

## Events: controller

* G3 only generates events except home, which is generated by the plugin

### homeDoc-updated

* signals update of the G3 login to HunterDouglas
* ACTION: just logged

### home

* plugin generated
* sequentially update all shades, scenes once per longPoll
* ACTION: each node checks once per shortPoll;updates then removes itself from array

## Events: scene

### scene-activated

* sent on completion of movement to scene positions from any source
* ACTION:
  * G3 turn on ST, Activated
  * G2 turned on when plugin activates scene (does not get info from remote or app)

### scene-deactivated

* signal movement away from scene positions immediate from any source
* ACTION:
  * G3 turn off ST, Activated
  * G2 is turned off on next longPoll when plugin activates scene
  * G2 (does not get info from remote or app

## Events: shade

### shade-online

* kind of a heartbeat which keeps the sse client-server connection alive
* ACTION: update position to currentPosition, logged as info
* not sure how often this is pushed from the G3 side

### shade-offline

* assume this is generated by G3 if it cannot communicate with shade
* ACTION: update position to currentPosition, logged as error

### motion-started

* ACTION: set the ST, Motion flag, update position to targetPosition

### motion-stopped
