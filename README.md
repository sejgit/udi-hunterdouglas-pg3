This plugin/nodeserver provides an interface between HunterDouglas Shades
and Polyglot V3 server supporting Universal Devices EISY or Polisy controllers

### Get your amazing EISY at [**Universal-Devices**][udi]

### Screenshots are [**here**][screenshots]

## Installation

You can install This node server from the PG3 NodeServer Store.\
Configuration help is available [**here**][configuration]

## Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** This is for HunterDouglas V3 API only, V2 API is out of scope\
Which means you must have PowerView G3 gateways\
If I have enough demand I may add basic V2 control & polling

This node server will only run on Polyglot version 3. You will
need to have an EISY/Polisy with PG3 installed to run this node server
