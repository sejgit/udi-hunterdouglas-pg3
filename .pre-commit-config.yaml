        # If you want to allow repos without tests, you can use one of these approaches:
        # 1. Add this to pytest.ini: testpaths = test (and pytest will skip if test/ doesn't exist)
        # 2. Use: bash -c 'pipenv run pytest || [ $? -eq 5 ]' (exit code 5 = no tests collected)
        # 3. Use: bash -c 'pipenv run pytest || true' (always pass, not recommended)
        # Currently using approach #2 - fails on real errors but passes if no tests found
        entry: bash -c 'pipenv run pytest || [ $? -eq 5 ]'
