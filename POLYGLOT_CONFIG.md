This Poly provides an interface between HunterDouglas window shades and [Polyglot PG3](https://github.com/UniversalDevicesInc/pg3-dist) server.

[This thread](https://forum.universal-devices.com/topic/tobedeterminded) on UDI forums has more details, ask questions there.

 1. This is for HunterDouglas V3 API only, V2 API is out of scope

 2. Currently, if you have more than one Gateway (I have two), you will need more than one plugin/nodeserver
 
 3. Best to set your gateway to a determined IP through your router

 4. You will need to define the following custom parameters:
     - `gatewayip` - defaults to **powerview-g3.local**
