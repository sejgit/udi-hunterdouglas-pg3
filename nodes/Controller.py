    The Node class represents a node on the ISY. The first node started and

    server's on-line/off-line status.

    This node will also typically handle discovery & creation of other nodes
    and deal with the user configurable options of the node server.

    Class Variables:
      self.name: String name of the node
      self.address: String Address of Node, must be less than 14 characters

    Class Methods
      query(): Queries and reports ALL drivers for ALL nodes to the ISY.
